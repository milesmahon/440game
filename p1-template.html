<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
Create an AI to play the turn-based game Atropos using game-tree search techniques.
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>We implemented a Minimax search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. At each board, there are at most 18 different moves to make (6 positions to fill with 3 colors each)
</p>

<p>
Briefly outline the functions you created in your code to carry out your algorithmic steps described above.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>
Describe your experiments, including the number of tests that you
performed, and the relevant parameter values.  </p>
<p>
Define your evaluation
metrics, e.g., detection rates, accuracy, running time. </p>


<hr>
<h2> Results</h2>
<p>
List your experimental results.  Provide examples of input images and output
images. If relevant, you may provide images showing any intermediate steps
</p>

<p>

<hr>
<h2> Discussion </h2>

<p> 
Discuss your method and results:
<ul>
<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of your method? </li>
<li>Do your results show that your method is generally successful or
     are there limitations? Describe what you expected to find in your
     experiments, and how that differed or was confirmed by your
     results. </li>
<li>Potential future work. How could your method be improved?   What
would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the
failures/limitations of your work?</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<p>
Based on your discussion, what are your conclusions?  What is your
main message?
</p>


<hr>
<h2> Credits and Bibliography </h2>
<p>

Cite any papers or other references you consulted while developing
your solution.  Citations to papers should include the authors, the
year of publication, the title of the work, and the publication
information (e.g., book name and publisher; conference proceedings and
location; journal name, volume and pages; technical report and
institution).  Material on the web should include the url and date of
access.
</p>

<p>
Credit any joint work or discussions with your classmates.
