<h2> Instructions to build </h2>
<p>
g++ -o bwebPlayer bwebPlayer.cc
</p>
<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
Create an AI to play the turn-based game Atropos using game-tree search techniques.
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>We implemented a Minimax search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. 
At each board, there are at most 18 different moves to make (6 positions to fill with 3 colors each), 
so the game has a branching factor of at most 18. 
</p>

<p>
We created a Board class to process and contain information about boards given as strings. We also created
a Triangle class which groups sets of 3 colors on the board which are mutually adjacent. This facilitates
checking for if the game is ended or not. We created and tested multiple evaluation functions which take
in a Board and give a static integer evaluation of the strength of that board.

</p>

<hr>
<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>
We tested our many evaluation functions against the random player and against each other in matches of 50 rounds with the same search depth of 6. We had 5 different
static evaluators:
1. Count the amount of available moves around the last move.
2. Count the amount of non-losing available moves around the last move.
3. Count how many different colors are represented around the last move. 
   This has a range of [0, 3].
4. Count how many of each color are represented around the last move. Take the max of those 4 colors counts.
5. Count how many of each color are represented around the last move. Take the max and multiply by -1.
   This is the inverse of Eval(4).
</p>
<p>
<li>Eval(2) beat Evals (1) and (3). </li>
<li>Eval(4) beat Evals (1) (2) (3). </li> 
<li>Eval(5) beat Eval (4) handily but faired worse against (2). </li> 
<li>Eval(4) did the best against a random player with a winning percentage of (78%). </li> 
<li>Evals (1), (2), (4), and (5) had significantly faster search times than Eval (2), allowing them to search
at higher depths. </li> 
<li>When given depths 1 larger than Eval (2), Evals (4) and (5) beat Eval (2) more consistently. </li> 
<li>All Eval functions did better than average against a random player. </li> 
</p>

<p>

<hr>
<h2> Discussion </h2>

<p> 
Discuss your method and results:
<ul>
<li>We chose to use Eval(4) because of its speed and general proficiency against the other Eval functions
and the random player. We believe it has the best play against diverse opponents while Eval(5) may
be specialized against Eval(4) because of their similarity.</li>
<li>We could expand upon this project by prioritizing exploration in promising paths. We could also use other search techniques
like Monte-Carlo tree search.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Conclusions </h2>
Minimax game tree search with alpha-beta pruning can be an effective and efficient way for an AI to play 
turn-based games.
